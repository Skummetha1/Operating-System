# Virtual Operating System Simulator

## Overview
The **Virtual Operating System Simulator** is a Java-based application designed to emulate the functionalities of an operating system within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This project focuses on simulating key OS concepts, such as process scheduling, device management, process messaging, and virtual memory, providing a hands-on approach to understanding operating system fundamentals.

## Features
- **Priority-Based Process Scheduling**: Implements a scheduling mechanism that allocates CPU time to processes based on their priority.
- **Task Switching and Quantum System**: Simulates task switching and fair CPU allocation through a quantum-based system.
- **Device Management**: Handles virtual devices and simulates hardware interaction within the JVM environment.
- **Virtual Memory Implementation**: Includes a paging system to simulate memory management and address space isolation.
- **Process Messaging**: Facilitates inter-process communication through message-passing mechanisms.
- **Cooperative Multitasking Model**: Simulates real-world multitasking through a cooperative model.
- **Soft Interrupt Mechanism**: Allows user programs to invoke operating system functions through soft interrupts, mimicking mode switching between user and privileged modes.
